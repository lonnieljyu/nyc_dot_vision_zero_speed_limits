# NYC DOT Vision Zero Speed Limits
Datasets from http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/vz_datafeeds.shtml#speed and one sample dataset from http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#realtime  
The geoJSONs are currently too large to be viewed in Github but you can use an online geoJSON validator to view in-browser, like http://geojsonlint.com/.
